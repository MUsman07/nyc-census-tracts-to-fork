New York City, as one of the world’s most diverse metropolitan areas, provides a unique lens for examining how economic opportunities are distributed across different communities. Understanding these patterns is crucial for:\n\nPolicy Development: Informing targeted interventions and resource allocation\nCommunity Planning: Identifying areas that may benefit from economic development initiatives\n\nSocial Justice: Documenting disparities that affect educational, health, and housing outcomes\nResearch: Contributing to broader discussions about urban inequality and segregation"
