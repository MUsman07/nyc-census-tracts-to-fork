## Project Overview

This project examines income inequality across New York City's diverse neighborhoods through the lens of race and geography. Using census tract-level data, we analyze median household income patterns across NYC's five boroughs to understand how economic opportunities vary by both racial demographics and location.

## The Data

Our analysis is based on **2,242 census tract observations** across New York City, containing:

- **Geographic Coverage**: All five NYC boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)
- **Demographic Variables**: Racial and ethnic categories including White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations
- **Economic Indicator**: Median household income by census tract
- **Spatial Resolution**: Census tract level (the smallest geographic unit for which the Census Bureau publishes sample data)

## Why This Matters

Income inequality remains one of the most pressing social and economic issues of our time. New York City, as one of the world's most diverse metropolitan areas, provides a unique lens for examining how economic opportunities are distributed across different communities. Understanding these patterns is crucial for:

- **Policy Development**: Informing targeted interventions and resource allocation
- **Community Planning**: Identifying areas that may benefit from economic development initiatives  
- **Social Justice**: Documenting disparities that affect educational, health, and housing outcomes
- **Research**: Contributing to broader discussions about urban inequality and segregation

## Methodology

Our analysis employs three complementary visualization approaches:

1. **Borough-Level Distribution Analysis**: Box plots showing income ranges and variability within each racial group across different boroughs
2. **City-Wide Comparison**: Violin plots revealing the overall distribution shapes and ranking of racial groups by median income
3. **Cross-Borough Comparison**: Bar charts enabling direct comparison of how racial income gaps manifest differently across NYC's geography

## Key Research Questions

This analysis addresses several important questions:

- How do income levels vary between racial groups within each NYC borough?
- Are income disparities consistent across all boroughs, or do they vary by location?
- Which communities have the greatest income variability, and what might this suggest about economic mobility?
- How do neighborhood-level patterns contribute to broader metropolitan inequality?

## Technical Approach

The analysis was conducted using R with the following key packages:
- `ggplot2` for data visualization
- `dplyr` for data manipulation and summary statistics
- `stringr` for text processing of geographic identifiers

Data cleaning involved extracting borough information from census tract names and standardizing racial category classifications for consistent analysis.

## Limitations and Considerations

While this analysis provides valuable insights, it's important to note several limitations:

- **Temporal Snapshot**: The data represents a specific time period and may not reflect current conditions
- **Aggregation Level**: Census tract medians may mask within-tract variation
- **Sample Representation**: Some racial groups may have limited representation in certain boroughs
- **Causation**: The analysis describes patterns but does not establish causal relationships

## Future Directions

This analysis opens several avenues for deeper investigation:
- Temporal trends in income inequality over multiple census periods
- Intersection with housing costs and affordability
- Relationship between income patterns and access to services, education, and employment opportunities
- Integration with other demographic and social indicators
